        "\n",
        "1. We want to use a subset of the buildings so that we are not overwhelmed by the amount of data to analyze during the tutorial 🙂. Since CityLearn is primarily designed for district level energy management and coordination we should use more than 1 building, although a 1-building environment is possible. An considerable building count for tutoring purposes is 2-3.\n",
        "2. We want to use only a one-week period from the entire one-year period for this tutorial for the same reason of ease of analysis.\n",
        "3. Instead of using the [full observation space](https://www.citylearn.net/overview/observations.html) that will take a while to explore and converge in RL implementations, we will narrow down the space to only one observations: `hour`. This is not the best set up because the hour alone does not explain the state transitions in the environment that the agent is observing, nevertheless, it will help highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different control algorithms.\n",
        "4. CityLearn allows for two control strategies: centralized and decentralized as earlier discussed. In this tutorial we will make use of the former.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will make these modifications directly in the schema. To keep things interesting, the buildings and one-week period will be pseudo-randomly selected but for reproducibility, we will set the random generator seed. This seed can be changed to any value to select another pseudorandom set of buildings and time period. Also, we will provide a method to set the observations we want to use in our simulations so that later down the line, it will be easy to switch and utilize other observations. We will define three functions to help us make these decisions:"

        "We will start simple with a rule-based control (RBC) agent that you will build yourself_! RBC is a popular control strategy that is used in most systems e.g. HVAC, batteries, etc because of their level of simplicity. They are  best described as a set of rules expressed as if-else statements and conditions that guide their decision making. An example of such statement is `if outdoor dry-bulb temperature is 20 degrees Celcius and hour 10 PM, charge battery with 5% of capacity`. Now the actual implementation of this statement is open-ended as a designer can choose to program it using any programming language e.g. Python (as used in CityLearn) or a proprietary language that the battery manufacturer uses. Nevertheless, at a high-level, it simplifies to a set of statements and conditions that are easily understood and mappable (think decision tree in supervised learning).\n",
        "\n",
        "The RBC you will be designing here, is a set of if-else statements that use the `hour` observation to determine the amount of energy to charge or discharge a battery. Remember we are using a centralized control strategy thus, the if-else statements you define will apply to all batteries in all buildings.\n",

You will design a custom RBC that inherits from an existing RBC in CityLearn called the [HourRBC](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.agents.rbc.html#citylearn.agents.rbc.HourRBC). Inheritance, allows us to copy existing properties and methods in the parent class, `HourRBC`, into our custom class. The `HourRBC` class allows one to define a custom `action_map` using the `hour` as the if condition and the battery capacity proportion as the action where negative proportions imply discharging and positive proportions imply charging.\n",

This balancing allows the agent to avoid local minima (exploration), while striving towards convergence (exploitation). In practice, $\\epsilon$ is set relatively large in the beginning of the learning process, and then reduced progressively.

        "Tabular Q-Learning is affected by the curse of dimensionality: as the size of the state space increases due to, e.g., continuous sensor inputs, the size of the Q-table has to necessarily increase is well. In particular for building control, the curse of dimensionality is significant, considering the potentially large number of sensors measuring various quantities (temperature, humidity, energy consumption, etc.) continuously. This means that the agent has an exponentially increasing number of state-action pairs to explore before it can converge to an optimal solution. Function approximators, e.g., linear regression or artificial neural networks ([Haykin (2009)](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/neural-networks-and-learning-machines/P200000003278/9780133002553)), have been proposed as solutions that allow generalization by directly mapping the state-action pairs, $(s, a)$, to their respective Q-value, $Q(s, a)$.
